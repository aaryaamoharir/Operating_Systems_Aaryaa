# Devlog

This is a developer log.

Created an initial logger file. Today I hope to get a basic setup of the program down and I've decided to use Python for this project.

Ended the session for today. I was going to start working on the driver program first, but it might be easier if I make sure the encryption is working fine, so I'll get started on that.
After a little bit of research, I can now understand what the Vigen√®re cipher does. It's essentially a more complicated Caesar cipher where the key (a string of letters) tells you how 
many positions to shift each letter of the message by. I was also able to get some good progress on the logger file and set it up so that I was able to enter multiple strings in my logger 
My next session I want to focus on the encryption program now that I have a better understanding of the Vigenere cipher.

Finished the session for today. I completed the decryption part of the program.It was pretty straightforward since I could just subtract the 
values instead of adding. I also worked on the encryption program and the was also fairly straightforward. I realized one of the errors in my 
program calculates the value of a as 0 so it doesn't add enough letters to the final value.

I need to start working on the driver program that will connect my logger and encryption program. I know I need to use pipes in order to connect the output of the two processes 
(logger and encryption program). I'm not entirely sure how to only log changes for only a specific run, so I'll need to look into that.

I'm currently thinking of using an array to store the history. This could also store previous passwords, and since it's an array, I can delete the history once the program is over.

Finished implementing the initial driver, but now I get to run it and see where all of my errors stem from!  

---

# 2025-03-18 14:24  
Once I submit a command to encryption, it closes the pipe, so it's not able to accept more commands.  

---

# 2025-03-18 14:41  
Finished the session. The reason it was closing the pipe was because of the way my encryption program was set up. I changed it so that it continues to run until it receives the QUIT message.  
I was able to finish the basic part of driver.pu but I need to better format the log file, add in error checking, and ensure that the user is only inputting allowed characters. I also need to add a way 
to exit once a person decides to use a string from history. This is what my logging looks like right now: 
Program started. ERROR: No passkey set. RESULT: Passkey set. RESULT: AARYAA. RESULT: AARYAA. Driver program exit. QUIT.

Today I want to work on fixing my logger formatting. The issue with why the logger was not writing out individual commands per 
line was because I wasn't ending each logger message in a newline. I need to work on allowing a user to go back if they click on 
using commands from history and then decide to enter a newline instead. 

---
# 2025-03-23 19:22  
Ended the session today. I realized I needed a separate devlog file and a logger.py file so I had to go back 
and fix that by extracting all the logger details in the logger file. I also realized that I don't necessarily 
like how the logger is formatted currently, so I changed that during this session as well. I fixed up some of 
the statements and cleaned up my code a little bit. I also added logic to return to a place to enter a new string 
if they already entered history. 

---
# 2025-03-24 14:31  
Today I need to test out this program on the cs1 server. I also realized that I need to fix my devlog.md 
to not include the logger statements so I went ahead and fixed my devlog formatting. 

---
# 2025-03-24 19:22  
Ended the session today. I tested it out on the CS1 server and it seems like it is working as expected! I need to make a 
readme file which I'll work on later today. There was also a logic issue with my for statements so I fixed that as well!

I'm adding finishing touches before I submit. There are some error output issues that I'm currently working on fixing. 
I hope this doesn't take too long and after that I should be ready to submit.

Submitting now! This project was definitely interesting and gave me a good foundation for how to use the python 
subprocess module. However, I apologize to the ta's in advance because the code is quite messy since I was 
constantly realizing that I forgot to account for certain edge cases or requirements.
